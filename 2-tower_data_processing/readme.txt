1 - To process the tower data related to evapostranspiration, we first created a list of all tables/stations selected based on the forest area around the towers. The tables downloaded from the FLUXNET website refers to the daily (DD) values. 
We read each table separate in a for looping. For each table, we selected only the columns (TIMESTAMP,TA_F_MDS,LE_F_MDS,LE_CORR, LE_F_MDS_QC) that would be used later on. We removed any observations before 2000. We also filtered the values by their quality control flag. Only values >0.75 were used. We removed the months with <60% of the days with valid observations. After all these filters, we converted the LE (latent heat) values into evapotranspiration using different approaches. The first approach was the "MU" approached described in http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2011.02.019. The second was the FAO approach, however, it was not used at the end. As final step, we calculated the monthly mean and save the new tables with the station names. 

2 - For GPP, we used a similar process. First filter was the removal all observations before 2000. Then, convert any observation <0 to "NA". We also used the quality flag value of >0.75. We kept only those months with >=21 days of valid observations. Then, we calculated the monthly GPP mean.
